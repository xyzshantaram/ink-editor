## My favourite Kafka quotes

* "You are the knife I turn inside myself; that is love. That, my dear, is love.”
* "Yours
  
  (now I'm even losing my name - it was getting shorter and shorter all the time and is now: Yours)"
* "I'm tired, can't think of anything and want only to lay my face in your lap, feel your hand on my head and remain like that through all eternity."

...or write your own:

## I'm looking for ... 

A relationship where we go to the park on cute picnics and listen to music together.

You can even make sections with lines and headings.

## The section of your bio where you reveal your deepest darkest desires

Got some poetry? Put it in a block:

\`\`\`
A faint clap of thunder
Clouded skies
Perhaps rain comes
If so, will you stay here with me ?

    A faint clap of thunder
Even if rain comes not
I will stay here
Together with you
\`\`\`

Or if code's more your style:

\`\`\`
function fib(n) {
    if (n == 0 || n == 1) return n;
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
}
\`\`\`
